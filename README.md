# Timelapser

Timelapser is a galimulator mod that renders the current state of the map into .png files.

## Dependencies

 - SLCubed (recommended, but not really needed)
 - Starloader (any version)
 - Starloader-API 1.2 or higher
 - Java 11 or higher with Java AWT working

## Configurabillity

Right now the mod does not support any form of configurabillity without recompiling it,
this will be changed one day (TM) but if you wish to make it happen now, then do not
hesitate to open a PR.
